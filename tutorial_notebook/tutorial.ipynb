    "\n",
    "$$bel \\left( A \\right) = 1 - pl \\left(A^c\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to derive such function. In this notebook, we present belief functions *à la Dempster* which are induced by a random set. Let $(\\Omega,\\sigma_\\Omega,\\mu)$ denote a  probability space. Define a mapping $\\Gamma$ from $\\Omega$ to the set of subsets of $\\Theta$. Under measurability conditions, $\\Gamma$ is a **random set**. We can define the two following pseudo-inverse for $\\Gamma$:\n",
    "$$ \\Gamma^{-1}_{\\top}\\left(B\\right) = \\left\\lbrace \\omega | \\Gamma\\left(\\omega\\right)\\cap B \\neq \\emptyset \\right\\rbrace,\\forall B\\subseteq \\Theta ,\\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, we have $pl = \\mu \\circ \\Gamma^{-1}_{\\top}$ and $bel = \\mu \\circ \\Gamma^{-1}_{\\bot} $.\n",

    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to our inference problem for $\\theta$, we can use the likelihood based belief function. The corresponding plausibility function is defined as \n",

    "This model stems from the probability space $(U,\\sigma_U,\\lambda)$ where $U$ is the unit interval, $\\sigma_U$ the Borel sigma-field on this interval and $\\lambda$ is the uniform probability measure. Now, by mapping each $u \\in U$ to the $\\alpha$-cut of function $\\frac{\\mathcal{L} \\left( \\theta ; \\mathcal{D} \\right)}{\\mathcal{L} \\left( \\bar{x} ; \\mathcal{D} \\right)}$, we span the above plausibility function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the specific case of the Likelihood based belief function, we also have random interval interpretation. In this case, we build the belief function by choosing uniformly a confidence level $\\alpha$ and propagate the correponding probability measure to the $\\alpha$-cuts of the likelihood function. $bel\\left(H\\right)$ is then the probability that the random interval is included in $H$ while $pl\\left(H\\right)$ is the probability that the random interval intersects $H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Belief functions and decision theory\n",

    "Like the Bayesian paradigm, making decisions with belief functions can also be formalized using expected utility. \n",

For this purpose, we need to resort a non-additive integral now as Choquet integral. Let alone these technicalities, making decisions using a belief function shares the same philosophy as in the Bayesian case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, also pick a loss function. In the sequel, we will go for a different loss function as before but our aim is still the same. We need to pick an estimate of $\\theta$ and a small condidence interval which is believed to contain $\\theta$. We will also penalize incorrect estimations, large intervals and intervals that miss $\\theta$.\n",
    "* Second, update your prior information with your data. The information drawn from the data is embodied by the likelihood based belief function. The prior information is also a belief function. The two functions are combined through an operation called Dempster's rule which we do not detail here. In the case your prior information is a probability distribution, then Dempster's rule yields a posterior distribution which conincides with the Bayesian approach. In the sequel, we choose a genuinely uninformative prior, i.e. a vacuous belief function ($bel = 1_\\Theta$).\n",
    "* Finally, choose the action that minimizes the integrated cost. However, we have two non additive measures against which it can be integrated :\n",
    "  $$ (C)\\int J\\: dbel  \\text{ (Conservative approach)},\\\\\n",
    "  (C)\\int J\\: dpl  \\text{ (Optimistic approach)},$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  where $(C)\\int$ is the Choquet integral symbol.\n",
    "  \n",
    "We also need to define a notion of \"condidence\" interval for belief functions. Here, we propose to define $I_\\alpha$ as the centered interval on the MLE such that $bel \\left( I_\\alpha \\right) = 1 - \\alpha$ which is understood as the probability that $\\theta \\in I_\\alpha$ is at least $1 - \\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like Bayesians do with Savage's theorem, BF practionners invoke Gilboa's theorem to claim that the BF approach is compliant with rational decision making. As proved by Gilboa, appraising the cost of an action based on expected utility relying on non-additive measures translates into a sound preference relation among actions. However, two important restrictions appear in Gilboa's axiomatization: the utility function must be bounded (we will comply to this requirement in the sequel) and the non-additive measure must have convex range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing a loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "The non-additivity of belief function does not only prevent us from using many mathematical results but also lead to non-intuitive calculations for people who are familiar with standard probability calculus. In particular, we can use the $0-1$ loss $L_{0-1}$ for the estimation of $\\theta$, while this would be pointless in the probabilistic case as singletons have null Lebesgue measure. In the likelihood belief function case, we have \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (C)\\int L_{0-1}\\: dbel = 1 - pl \\left( \\hat{\\theta} \\right) ,\\\\\n",
    "  (C)\\int L_{0-1}\\: dpl = 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that for the 1st cost we obtain $\\hat{\\theta} = \\bar{x}$, while with the second we cannot draw any conclusion. We thus adopt here the 1st approach for the estimation of $\\theta$, and the method  `BaselineBF.estimate` thus returns the MLE estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the interval estimation problem, we will use the same cost function as before, and we obtain\n",
    "$$ (C)\\int \\vert I\\vert + 1_{\\theta\\notin I} \\: dbel = \\gamma \\vert I_\\alpha \\vert ,\\\\\n",
    "  (C)\\int  \\vert I\\vert + 1_{\\theta\\notin I}\\: dpl = \\gamma \\vert I_\\alpha \\vert + \\alpha .$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "This time, it is the second cost minimization that is instrumental because the 1st one is always minimized for $\\alpha=1$, meaning that $I_\\alpha = \\left\\lbrace \\bar{x} \\right\\rbrace$. So we see that we cannot use the same non-additive measure for both estimation problems. This is not much problematic as these two can be decoupled, yet we obviously cannot achieve the same level of unification as the Bayesian approach."

    "We focus on the optimistic cost as the conservative does not provide a sufficient level of information. In this experiment, the optimistic cost is minimized for the same value of $\\alpha$ as in the conjugate Bayes case. This may be purely conincidental as other values of $\\gamma$ may not lead to such a result. Obviously, when $\\gamma$ is small, both costs become closer. \n",
